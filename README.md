## 🏙️ Project Overview

**Urban Power** is a cross-platform React Native mobile application targeting the Indian market. It is a super-app that combines home services, e-commerce shopping, grocery delivery, and scrap/recyclable pickup (Kabadi) into a single unified experience.

The app supports **three user roles** — Customer, Technician (field partner), and Admin — each with a completely different interface and feature set.

> **Current Status:** This is a fully functional UI prototype. All data is mocked locally. A real backend integration is planned for a future release.

## ▶️ Running the App

### Option 1 — Expo Go App (Quickest, No Build Needed)

> Best for: testing the UI quickly on your real phone

```bash
npx expo start
```

1. Install **Expo Go** on your Android phone from Google Play Store
2. Make sure your phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi**
3. Scan the QR code shown in your terminal
4. The app will load on your phone instantly

### Option 2 — Android Emulator

```bash
# Start Expo server, then press 'a'
npx expo start

# OR run directly on Android
npx expo run:android
```

Make sure an Android Virtual Device (AVD) is **already running** in Android Studio before pressing `a`.

### Option 3 — Physical Android Device via USB

```bash
# Connect phone via USB with USB Debugging enabled, then:
npx expo run:android
```

---

## 📱 Running on Real Android Device

### Step 1 — Enable Developer Mode

1. Open **Settings** on your phone
2. Tap **About Phone**
3. Find **Build Number** — tap it **7 times rapidly**
4. You will see: *"You are now a developer!"*

### Step 2 — Enable USB Debugging

1. Go to **Settings → Developer Options**
2. Find **USB Debugging** and turn it **ON**
3. Confirm any popup that appears

### Step 3 — Connect to Computer

1. Connect your phone with a **data-capable USB cable** (not a power-only cable)
2. On your phone, when a popup appears: tap **"Allow USB Debugging"**
3. Check the **"Always allow from this computer"** box

### Step 4 — Verify the Connection

```bash
adb devices
```

Expected output:
```
List of devices attached
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    device
```

If you see `unauthorized`, unplug and replug your phone, then re-accept the prompt.

### Step 5 — Run the App

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

The app will be built and installed on your phone automatically.

## 🔨 Build Android APK

An APK file can be installed directly on any Android device.

### Debug APK (For Testing — No Signing Required)

```bash
# Step 1: Go into the android folder
cd android

# Step 2: Build (Windows)
gradlew assembleDebug

# Step 2: Build (Linux)
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Where is the APK?**
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Transfer this file to your phone (via USB, email, or WhatsApp) and install it.

### Release APK (Signed — For Sharing or Distribution)

> Requires creating a keystore first. See the full instructions:
> **➡️ [BUILD_GUIDE.md](./BUILD_GUIDE.md)**

```bash
cd android

# Windows
gradlew assembleRelease

# Linux
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Output:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## 📦 Build Android AAB

An AAB (Android App Bundle) is required for uploading to the **Google Play Store**.

```bash
cd android

# Windows
gradlew bundleRelease

# Linux
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

> For complete keystore setup, signing config, and production build notes:
> **➡️ [BUILD_GUIDE.md](./BUILD_GUIDE.md)**

## 🔐 Test Credentials

This app uses mock data. Use these to test all three user roles:

| Role | Phone Number | OTP | What You Can Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Customer** | Any 10-digit (e.g. `9999999999`) | Any 4 digits | Home, Services, Shop, Grocery, Kabadi, Cart, Account |
| **Admin** | `9876543210` | Any 4 digits | Admin Console, Order Management, User Management |
| **Technician** | `8888888888` | Any 4 digits | Partner Hub, Job Requests, Earnings |

> OTP is simulated — enter any 4-digit number to proceed.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Metro Bundler Cache Issues

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### Android Build Fails

```bash
# Clean Gradle and rebuild
cd android

# Windows
gradlew clean

# Linux
./gradlew clean

# Return to root
cd ..
npm install
npx expo run:android
```

### node_modules Corrupted

```bash
# Linux / Git Bash on Windows
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install
```

### App Won't Load on Phone (Expo Go)

1. Confirm phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**
2. Try: `npx expo start --tunnel`
3. Temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus

### Emulator Not Detected

1. Open **Android Studio → Device Manager**
2. Start your AVD (click the play button)
3. Wait until the emulator is fully booted (shows the Android home screen)
4. Then run `npx expo start` and press `a`

### `adb` Device Shows as `unauthorized`

1. Unplug the USB cable
2. Revoke USB debugging authorizations in Developer Options
3. Re-plug and re-accept the prompt on your phone

## 🗄️ Backend Status

> ⚠️ **This project has no live backend.**

All data is served from a local mock file:

```
src/constants/MockData.ts    ← Services, products, kabadi rates (hardcoded)
src/services/api.ts          ← Mock API with simulated delay (no real HTTP)
```

**What this means for developers:**
- ✅ No internet connection required to run the app
- ✅ No `.env` file or API keys needed
- ❌ All app data resets when you close the app (no persistence)
- ❌ OTP is simulated (any 4-digit code is accepted)
- ❌ User IDs are randomly generated on each login

**Packages installed but not yet in use:**
- `axios` — installed for future API calls, currently unused
- `react-hook-form` — installed, forms currently use `useState`

---

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

### Architecture Highlights
- **New Architecture enabled** — Fabric renderer + JSI for better performance
- **Hermes JS engine** — faster startup, lower memory usage
- **Edge-to-edge display** — app renders behind Android system bars
- **TypeScript strict mode** — `"strict": true` enforced throughout

### Design Token System (`src/constants/Theme.ts`)
- `Colors.light` / `Colors.dark` — full dual-theme color palette
- `Spacing` — 8-level spacing scale (2px → 64px)
- `Typography` — 8 text variants (h1 → tiny)
- `Shadows` — 4 elevation levels
- `BorderRadius` — 7 levels including `full: 9999`

> Note: Dark mode tokens are fully prepared but the theme switcher is not yet wired.

### State Architecture
All global state is managed by Zustand (in-memory only, resets on app restart):
- `useAuthStore` — user info, role, login/logout
- `useCartStore` — items, quantities, totals
- `useBookingStore` — all booking records
- `useKabadiStore` — scrap pickup requests
- `useServiceBookingStore` — service-specific booking records

---

## 🌐 Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | ✅ Fully Supported | New Architecture + Hermes, API 24+ |
| **Web** | ⚠️ Experimental | `npx expo start --web` (limited UI) |

> **Minimum Android version:** Android 7.0 (API level 24)
> **Target Android version:** Android 15 (API level 35)

---
